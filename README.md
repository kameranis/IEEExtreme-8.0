# IEEExtreme-8.0
Code submitted to IEEExtreme 8.0 24-hour programming competition

Code has been submitted nearly a year after the competition took place.
It serves to demonstrate the coding that is needed in this competition and should by no means be used as production code. (If you really fancy it, you can use it and please give credit, but I believe you can propably find or write much better code than me on 2 hours of sleep).
